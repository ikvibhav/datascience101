# LLMs
- Transformers package
    - Makes easy to download hugging face models and run on computer
- Hugging Face
    - OpenSource Repo with multiple AI models
- Langchain
    - Makes it easy to use LLM models
    - Allows to use multiple models together and make more advanced applications and just deal with LLMs
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) -
    - Its a process of optimizing the output of an LLM, so that it references an authoritative knowledge base outside its training data sources before generating a response
    - RAG extends powerful capabilites of LLMs to specific domains of an organizations's internal knowledge base, thus removing the need to retrain the model
    - Authoritative knowledge base ensures that the model can provice accurate, credible and contexually relevant information
- LangFlow -
    - Used to create AIProjects (Flows)
- VectorDB Search
    - VectorDB is a specialized databse designed to store, index and query high dimensional vector embeddings. Vector embeddings are numerical representations of data generated by ML models
    - Makes use of Efficient Similiarity Search - Finds vectors closest to given query vector using cosine or Euclidean similiarity measures
    - UseCases,
        - Semantic Search - Retrieve documents based on meaning rather than exact keywords.
        - Recommendation Systems -  Suggest Items based on vector similiarity
        - Image/Audio Search - Find similiar images using embeddings
    - FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)
- OLLAMA
    - OLLAMA is a platform designed to run and manage LLMs locally on a machine.
    - It focuses on privacy, efficiency and offline capabilities
