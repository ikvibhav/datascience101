# LLMs
- Transformers package
    - Makes easy to download hugging face models and run on computer
- Hugging Face
    - OpenSource Repo with multiple AI models
- Langchain
    - Makes it easy to use LLM models
    - Allows to use multiple models together and make more advanced applications and just deal with LLMs
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) -
    - Its a process of optimizing the output of an LLM, so that it references an authoritative knowledge base outside its training data sources before generating a response
    - RAG extends powerful capabilites of LLMs to specific domains of an organizations's internal knowledge base, thus removing the ned to retrain the model
    - Authoritative knowledge base ensures that the model can provice accurate, credible and contexually relevant information
- LangFlow -
    - Used to create AIProjects (Flows)
